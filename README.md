Carabao.js is a lightweight and minimalist web library designed to simplify web development on top of the popular Express.js framework. Drawing inspiration from the philosophy of Ruby on Rails, Carabao.js aims to minimize configuration and provide developers with a seamless and intuitive development experience.

With Carabao.js, you can leverage the power of Express.js while benefiting from additional abstractions and conventions that simplify common web development tasks. It offers a layer of abstraction over Express.js, reducing the need for extensive configuration and boilerplate code.

## Key Features

### Simplified Configuration

Carabao.js reduces the complexity of setting up an Express.js application by providing sensible defaults and eliminating the need for excessive configuration. Developers can quickly get started with minimal setup and focus on building their application logic.

### Convention over Configuration

Following the principle of "convention over configuration," Carabao.js promotes a set of predefined conventions that simplify the development process. This approach reduces the decision-making burden on developers, as they can rely on the established conventions to guide their application's structure.

### Intuitive Routing

Carabao.js introduces a streamlined routing mechanism that allows developers to define routes using a concise syntax. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and mapping them to the appropriate controller or action.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

Inspired by Ruby on Rails, Carabao.js encourages the adoption of the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a clear separation of concerns between models, views, and controllers, making code organization and maintenance more straightforward.

### Integrated Templating

Carabao.js offers built-in support for templating engines, allowing developers to seamlessly render dynamic views. By integrating popular templating engines such as EJS or Handlebars, it simplifies the process of generating HTML responses.

### Middleware and Plugins

Carabao.js seamlessly integrates with Express.js middleware and provides a plugin system for extending its functionality. Developers can leverage the rich ecosystem of Express.js middleware and add additional features as needed.
